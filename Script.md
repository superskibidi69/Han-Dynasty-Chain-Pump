Hello Sharks, my name is Hantang and I’m totally the founder of chain pumps. Today, I’m here to ask for ¥340000 in exchange for 36% of my company and sales.
You might be wondering: what is the chain pump?
The chain pump is a tool that simplifies irrigation. It consists of square boards rotating on a circular chain, allowing for faster and less tiring irrigation.
      
Before the chain pump, farmers had to manually pull water using buckets. This invention simplified the process by requiring only manpower to operate a pedal, which rotates the chain. The square boards trap water, which is then emptied into an irrigation ditch, significantly improving agricultural efficiency.
Here is an explanation of how it works:
a farmer or an animal will drive on these pedals, which turns the biards.as it reaches the top, the water is emptied into an irrigation ditch. simple, and effective. The benefits of this is that it uses less energy.
Sharks, I hope to partner with one of you to make this product successful.
Thank you for listening. I believe in this product, and I hope it’s going to make irrigation easier. I hope you’ll accept my offer.
