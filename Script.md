Hello Sharks, my name is Hantang and I’m totally the founder of chain pumps. Today, I’m here to ask for ¥340000 in exchange for 36% of my product. 
You might be wondering: what is the chain pump?
The chain pump simplified irrigation. It consists of square boards rotating on a circular chain, allowing for faster and less tiring irrigation.
      
Before the chain pump, farmers had to manually pull water using buckets. This invention simplified the process by requiring only manpower to operate a pedal, which rotates the chain. The square boards trap water, which is then emptied into an irrigation ditch, significantly improving agricultural efficiency.
Here is an explanation:
a farmer or an animals will drive on these pedals, which turns the biards.as it reaches the top, the water is emptied into an irrigation ditch. simple, and effective. This makes a massive difference, because it uses less energy.
